            <p class="sub-tag bgt">We help clients evolve systematically.
                In this perfect storm of a technology revolution, a global pandemic, deep recession and changing
                customer priorities, it is important to get things right the first time.

                Using 1.5 million datapoints from 5,000+ organizations, Trianz has developed a Digital Enterprise
                Evolution Model (DEEM) to help clients understand the patterns of digital evolution, prioritize
                correctly, and execute successfully to achieve stakeholder impact and rejuvenate their
                businesses.Pioneers in digital transformation are ahead because they were the first to take risks,
                experiment, invest ahead and iterate several times before getting the transformation process right.

                The challenge for companies that are just beginning their digital journey is understanding what to
                prioritize so that they correctly deploy their financial and people resources within a window of
                opportunity that is rapidly shrinking.</p>

            <p class="sub-tag bgt">We bring an extensive portfolio of business technology capabilities.
                Powered by research, perspectives and experience, we help clients transform their business ecosystems by
                leveraging our capabilities in infrastructure, cloud, analytics, digital, and security paradigms.

                For four years in a row, Trianz has been rated #1 by clients for predictable execution. 94% of our
                engagements are delivered on time.Cloud adoption at scale helps teams in the high tech industry rapidly
                create and deliver ‘minimal viable products’ (MVPs), so they can iterate based on feedback from the
                business and customer or partners. This ultimately leads to a much closer alignment of
                expected-versus-delivered value and experiences. Overall, digital transformations accelerate due to
                these faster delivery cycles and higher acceptance rates.</p>

            <p class="sub-tag bgt">As digitalization accelerates onward, infrastructure becomes a dynamic, complex, and
                critical part of the transformation game. There are three important facets of infrastructure management
                to consider during this digital shift.Benefits of cloud at scale: While companies in most industries are
                still figuring out their cloud strategy, high tech is seeing massive reduction in Infrastructure costs
                and acceleration of solution delivery due to its enterprise-wide adoption of cloud.First, the sheer
                volume and scope of change in applications and data landscapes create new demands of scale and
                management. Second, migrations to the cloud – which in reality will take several years for large
                organizations – create a need to manage both cloud and on-prem environments. And finally, the way
                infrastructure itself is managed is changing with the availability of new tools, automation, and
                artificial intelligence (AI).

            <p class="sub-tag bgt">
                Benchmarking should be the first step on your digital transformation journey. It will provide you with
                the insights needed to determine the digital gap between your organization and your competitors. It will
                also help you develop your vision and strategic priorities to catch up or leap ahead of your
                competition.

                We’ve collected data on digital transformations from business and IT leaders at more than 5,000
                companies across all revenue segments and 20 industries. This research has given us an understanding of
                how “digital champions” – what we call the 7% of companies that have been successful with digital
                transformation – have evolved to where they are today.

                Using a data-driven approach, we help companies understand where they are on the digital transformation
                spectrum, per our Digital Enterprise Evolution Model.Along with digitalization, business models and
                processes are changing from a traditional way of doing things to a new paradigm that requires new data
                inputs: “post-digital” key performance indicators (KPI), or new KPI.
